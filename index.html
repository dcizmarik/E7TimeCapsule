        <h3>The Critical Nature of Environmental Protection by Buchanan Kennedy IV Ph. D</h3>
        <p>Our Earth is dying. Our Earth is sustaining the life of the human population. Hence, our people are going to die should we not take action in regards to the environment. It is absolutely essential for our committee to realize that Environmental Protection is the most pressing topic of our time. Natural disasters are decimating the world, and rain forests, which produce huge amounts of the consumable oxygen in our atmosphere, are receding at unprecedented rates. It is critical that we put this issue first, and have it take precedence over issues of human rights an issues of violence. Though these may be extremely important and pressing issues, they do not hold the fate of the world in their grips. I strongly advocate for an interventionist policy in regards to climate change and other environmental issues.

        <h3>The Distraction of Militarization from the Importance of Economic Improvement in the Qing Dynasty by Autumn McDermott
</h3>
        <p>Upon visiting the Qing Dynasty Committee, I was struck with the heavy focus on increasing militarization. Debate was dominated with talk of the navy, and sending spies to India to gather intelligence on British ships was mentioned. There was some back-and-forth regarding how beneficial increasing military size would be regarding economic state, and it was noted that sending farmers to the army would decrease agricultural production and negatively impact the economy. However, some delegates did argue the value of the respect that would be gained from Western powers in developing a powerful military.
	It’s important to note, from seeing this committee in action, the negative impact that focus on militarization, as opposed to economic development, has on a society. Do the Qing Dynasty’s attempts to increase military size and strength, mainly for the sake of appearances, benefit them in the long run? Would it be more effective for them to keep their farmers at home, and gain power and stability through increasing agricultural production and trade to boost their economy?
	Today, we need to look at the misguidedness of the Qing Dynasty, and apply the lessons learned from their mistakes to the world today. We need to further develop our world, using tools such as safe nuclear energy to provide a clean energy source to power our needs. Focus on war--tearing each other apart--and allotting people and resources to that cause, will draw us from advancements that need to be made, and slow our progress with environmental improvement.

    <h3>Mid 1800's, China by Maria Gonzalez</h3>
    <p>The Quing Dynasty is coming to a point of chaos as new rules and regulations have taken place. Under Chinese law, citizens are no longer able to trade opium, a traded that employed many in China. On top of this, their ports are under foreign rule. These travesties are causing the people, especially those of the working and lower class, to begin to rebel. Riots are forming against the prohibition of the opioid trade and a solution needs to be created to solve the unemployment of the citizens.

The committee did address this issue, realizing that the unemployment of the masses is not only a violation against human rights but also a violation of the reputability of their own country. Yet, the way they want to deal with this issue varies significantly, with solutions ranging from a more military focus to the creation of more technologically advanced ships. It is still unclear how to effectively solve this violation as the solutions brought up are still rudimentary at best.

        <h3>Grain Shortage Discovered</h3>
        <p>Berlin---Germany is on the verge of famine.  Following the usual grain binge due to the hype of Oktoberfest in Bavaria, the entire country is severely low on grain production.  Even Oktoberfest had dangerously low amounts of beer, pretzels, and wienerschnitzel.  The German government fears that due to the environmental conditions as a result of Climate Change may cause the Country to cut back to a no wheat diet.  The grain storehouses are empty and the farmers are struggling to produce even enough to feed their local areas.
	Germany, a leading exporter of grain, not only fears their country may starve, but also their economy may begin to fail.  Their net exports have been slowly declining but analysts are projecting that this shortage will culminate in a serious hit for their GDP.  They also fear this inflation may cause a continent-wide depression in addition to the hunger of the masses.
	When talking with a grain farmer in Bavaria he shared his fears.  “DAS IST NICHT GUT!” (THIS ISN’T GOOD!).  “Wir haben ein schlechtes Jahr und das ist ein nochmal Problem. Ein sehr großes Problem.” (We are having a bad year and this is just another problem, a very big problem.)  The Germans fear that the rise in prices for flour and bread will cause nationwide hunger, and for a country that often houses poor migrants this could spell disaster.
	The EU released a statement on the grain shortage saying, “Our hope is that the Germans will be able to produce enough grain to sustain themselves for the rest of the year, but after that we have no means to provide for them considering they were Europe’s main supplier.  We can only hope that the farmers pull through with a great harvest next year.”
	Is this the end of Oktoberfest? Will Germany starve? Will the economy fail, leading to a Europe-wide depression? No one is sure, but the situation is dire.

        <h3>The Ignored Crisis of the World Food Programme
 by Emmett Brown</h3>
        <p>When examining the current food shortage and humanitarian disasters of the present, it is necessary to look back on past international actions to prevent the development of such a severe situation. However, the historical record proves unimpressive, and this can be narrowed down to one recurring issue: funding. For example, in the World Food Programme sessions back in 2019, factions formed between smaller nations like Vietnam and larger nations like China. While developed nations appeared more than willing to donate funds to developing nations, this was sometimes viewed as “neo-colonialism” by the developing nations who prefered self-sufficiency.

But funding has always been an issue in widespread policy and always will be. However, in the narrow focus of producing sustainable food, the answer counterintuitively lies in state-of-the-art technology. Even as early as 2019, nations like Japan began noticing that industrial polymers are incredibly absorbent and can actually be used to create an arable environment where previously there was only non arable land or land devastated by pollution and climate change. Considering the cheapness and reusability of this polymer technology, the overall cost of transforming non arable land to arable land is actually quite small in comparison to alternatives. When utilized in conjunction with hydroponic vertical farming, film farming may be the way future for a society with limited farmland to feed and ever-growing population.

Had the World Food Programme at the time understood the cost effectiveness of seemingly expensive solutions, the current state may have been prevented. However, it is still not too late to implement such sustainable farming techniques now to secure a stable future.

        <h3>Terrorism in Africa Distracts from Enviromental Problems by Jean Paul Berger</h3>
        <p>The African Union has been known to use the tools available to them to try and stop terrorists from poisoning their people. Lake Chad was chemically poisoned by an unknown terrorist group. The African Union’s focus was on trying to prevent the damage that could result from such an attack. They lacked interest in trying to solve the environmental problems that plague us today.
	This is a simple case of humans fighting humans rather than the larger problems that surround us, such as our environment. Helping people to see that other humans are not lessers, but equals will help to stop such terrorist attacks and focus our attention on our crumbling environment. Human rights issues must be addressed if the world is to be saved from our past mistakes.
