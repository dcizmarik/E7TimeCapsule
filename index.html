            <h3>The German Predicament
 By Buchanan Kennedy IV Ph. D</h3>
            <p>Germany, a nation long praised for its dedication and championing of frugality and monetary consistency, has grossly abused their budget to fund a frivolous celebration, Oktoberfest. Though the German government had full knowledge of a grain shortage in their nation, they felt that their tradition of excessive drinking be continued in the wake of this crisis. They do not deserve the help or sympathy of neither the United Nations Security Council nor the individual journalists in this committee. Our delegations should not advocate for any response to the German crisis; we must let the nation sort their domestic problems out by themselves, without the help of these United Nations. I find it ridiculous that some of my fellow delegates propose any sort of relief to Germany, since their disgusting abuse of a strained grain supply is clearly no fault of our own nations.
</p>

<h3>The Germany Crisis: A Potential Solution By
Emmett Brown
</h3>
<p>Germany, the EU’s greatest exporter of grains, has reached a point of grain shortage that is unprecedented. Already, folks in Germany are discussing the possibility of a no wheat diet, in light of their nation’s arable land no longer being optimal for wheat production. Another concern is how Germany’s struggle with economically impact an already shaky global system.

My take is that we send Germany as many resources it needs in order to make it through the rest of the year but also that we suggest leading German scientists to implement changes to germplasm, sowing dates, tilling, and water management into grain farming. By modifying the germplasm (seed) to be more adaptable to the increasingly arid climate of Europe, a more bountiful harvest may be produced.

However, much of the grain Germany produces must go towards feeding animals raised for slaughter. A silent cause for the current crisis is how much of the world’s produced grain is defaulted to livestock instead of humans. Thus, it is imperative that we move towards meat sustainably produced through vitro cultivation (lab meat) to allow grain resources to be opened up for human consumption.

Regardless of whether or not the UN chooses to take the above actions, one thing is for sure: There must be an increased public awareness of the food shortage crisis, particularly in developed nations previously unaffected. The current greatest source of food waste is in restaurants. Thus, we must ensure nations have national legislature in place to make excessive restaurant waste a punishable offense. Now is not the time for luxury at the expense of starving people. Furthermore, individual citizens must be able to identify superfluous meals in their daily intake and try to cut down. To you the reader, I challenge you to track your food intake over the next week and find at least three instances where you believe you can cut down on grain or meat consumption in the future.

Hey guys! Check out this new article I wrote for BBC about the Germany. This is not a crisis of grain production, but rather one of adapting to changing climates and reducing consumption.

I challenge you and everyone you know to track your food intake over the next week and find three instances where you believe you can cut down on grain or meat consumption in the future. The time for change is now!

            <h3>Push for Economic Freedom in Latin America By Anonymous</h3>
            <p>Machala, Ecuador-- The world is rapidly deteriorating, and countries in Central and South America are by no means exempt from the famine, instability, and desperation plaguing the global political landscape. The economy of Ecuador has taken a particularly devastating hit, resulting in widespread food insecurity and government gridlock. Excessive corporate regulations in combination with atrocious growing conditions due to climate change have obliterated the agriculture industries that these fragile countries rely on. Farmers and exporters in Machala, often considered to be the Banana Capital of the World, have gone bankrupt due to tight rules restricting growing practices. They are pleading to their leaders for a significant reduction of these corporate regulations in hopes of kick-starting this massive industry and reviving their suffering economy.

    <h3>Passive Intervention: A Brief Synopsis By Buchanan Kennedy IV Ph. D
</h3>
<p>As I advocated for in committee, passive intervention would involve a sort of “steering the conversation” mentality, rather than abrasive action. Influencing what topics are being discussed would expand the interventionist power of our committee without raising the dangers of direct intervention. Our committee should take careful action when regarding time travel, so as to not drastically affect the future with unforeseen consequences. These actions may include direct communication with delegates of past committees, and our attempt to influence them to steer their conversation towards our own interest. In regards to the environment, we should communicate with certain delegates in the African Union to hopefully have them bring up motions about environmental catastrophes and the poisoning of Lake Chad. Additionally, I believe that we should take a more aggressive stance on environmental protection than other issues, given the drastic circumstances our world now faces.

            <h3>Why Germany is to Blame for its own grain shortage
By Rachel Ailes
</h3>
<p>After the celebrations of Oktoberfest, Germany's grain supply had been severely depleted. The German government reached out to the European Union (EU) to ask for monetary and resource aid, however, the EU rejected this plea for help. Now it has fallen into the hands of United Nations Special Press Committee, which I am a member of, who must deal with this issue in our modern times after returning from viewing environmental disasters of the past. The fact that Germany, a developed nation, is now suffering from blights of famine, disease and infrastructure meltdowns, means that environmental crises are just as prevalent in developed nations as developing nations. This makes it clear that moving forward finance allocations for back-ups reserves of grain must be evenly distributed, and certain procedures must be set into place to mitigate the effects of large-scale events such as Oktoberfest on grain reserves. At the end of the day, Germany created this problem for itself by harvesting excess amounts of grain in order to fuel a celebration. However, this event did open up the eyes of the international community to the need for better fund/resources allocation in order to prevent policy decisions from negatively impacting innocent citizens.

    <h3>Nuclear Energy is our future? By Rachel Ailes</h3>
    <p>When looking at the historical precedent set by the improper use of nuclear technology, this global community becomes increasingly aware of the need for oversight of nuclear energy research initiatives. Nevertheless, nuclear energy can be the future of sustainability. In order to ensure clean energy sources for developing and developed nations, countries with established research facilities may form coalitions with nations who do not have access to such technology. Furthermore, some of the tension around the use of nuclear energy can be alleviated by switching from the use of uranium to thorium as nuclear fuel; as studies have proven that thorium reduces the risk of reactor meltdowns. Thorium is also a cleaner and cheaper source of nuclear fuel, which will allow nations to ramp up the production of nuclear energy reserves. In both the past and the present, pollution has diminished air quality and caused various harmful health effects. Thereby, switching to an alternative source of energy, such as nuclear energy, will be extremely beneficial to many nations.

    <h3>
Are the current farming methods sustainable?
 By Rachel Ailes</h3>
 <p>Simply put, farmers are always left behind in discussions regarding sustainable agriculture. However, what many of the past have failed to recognize is that farmers are merely wishing to sell their crops to gain a profit, and if scientists can provide them a way to do so while also implementing sustainable techniques, they would absolutely be willing entertain those ideas. This had led many to believe that the new era of sustainable agriculture lies in the development of technology such as aquaponics, micro-irrigation and fog harvesting. All of these methods will increase water security while ensuring that farmers are able to maintain cultivation of native crops. Another startling reality is that consecutive seasons of drought in East and South Africa has had a cataclysmic consequence on crop yields, thus decreasing income and stimulating inflation; which will cause food insecurity for over fifty million people. Thereby, countries should work to install drought-tolerant seed varieties in order to provide sustainable crop yields while protecting the incomes of many farmers. So, farming can become sustainable with the implementation of modern technology… but now we just need to get this information to the farmers themselves!

<h3>Misdirected food aid is prolonging conflicts in many regions
By Rachel Ailes
</h3><p>International conflicts are reignited by misdirected food aid. Food supplies in devastated areas can easily fall into the hands of corrupt entities or be lost in transit to rogue operations. The lack of security around monetary food aid, especially coming from the WFP, can allow for groups to gain enough capital to wage open conflict. The WFP mandated emergency shipments to crisis zones which were fungible; which led to as much as 80% of food aid being stolen before it reaches its intended destination. Taking this information into account, our current global food aid system must be amended to include highly secure monetary fund accounts that will transfer funds to organizations, such as NGOs, which will provide direct aid to areas in a state of emergency. We must ensure that in a world which is teetering on the edge disrepair that our food supply is protected, and in areas where food insecurity runs rampage, any and all aid that is supplied must be protected at all costs.
</p>



            <h3>We Only Have One World
By Rachel Ailes
</h3>
<p>Temperatures are rising, air quality is plummeting, and our people are suffering. The necessity for sustainable resources infrastructure has never been more prevalent. Our modern world is a repercussion of a lack of accountability for funding. We all know that the proposed 2030 World Hunger Plan set in place by the World Food Program (WFP) failed. However, when transported back to the WFP we see that many delegations are quite fond of this plan and quite naive in formulating ways to implement such an initiative. Coining the term "self-sustainability infrastructures" this committee had discussed how nations would fund infrastructure that was vital to ensuring crop protection, food waste management, and resource management.
	In the year 2019, we can also see that there is a war on the horizon between developing and developed nations. Developing nations, such as Syria and Tanzania, have mentioned the fact that developed nations, such as Vietnam, have been preaching a radical version of self-sustainability. These developing nations have cried for financial aid in order to progress at the same rate as powerhouse countries that will succeed in meeting the 2030 goals. In response, the delegation of Vietnam said, "Many developing countries were upset by my speeches promoting independent self-sustainability, but they fail to recognize the harsh reality of MDC influence, such as the influence the US had on Vietnam." This delegate is promoting the idea that developing nations need to only rely on a kickstart in funding and then transition to self-promotion/incentivization for sustainability, instead of risking neocolonialism and unwanted influence from developed nations. It is clear that in order to come to a conclusion the issue of funding for infrastructure must be resolved.

        <h3>Short Term or Long Term? By Debby White</h3>
        <p>A few decades ago, the African Union assembled in a crisis involving a terrorist attack on Chad.  The Union scrambled together to pen directives to alleviate the situation.  The terrorist attack was a chemical attack on Lake Chad, rendering the country without drinkable or usable water.  The African Union decided to focus on long-term versus short-term goals from regulating social media to donating water.  The delegates had trouble agreeing on what to do first, in the status quo, but a consensus was to look for stability of government and economy.  When asked about problems with corruption and influence of more developed countries exploiting the continent, the Union delegates generally agreed that a longterm solution would be nationalizing resources to fight such exploitation.  Two directives were given, with both deciding on providing drinking waters as long-term but not materialistic.  With NGO funding from Attack Against Terrorism, these directives focused on the link between terrorism and the Dark Web, proclaiming that ISIS and other terrorist groups use social media to invoke terror.  However, at the time, Africa did not have reliable internet infrastructure and access, but the Union thought the western world, which they were ironically trying to long-term mitigate exploitation from, would help by providing such infrastructure.  On the immediate terrorist threat, the Union believed that an intelligence committee and a terrorist attack coalition would also be a long-term goal -- a very paradoxical wording.  Providing drinking water would decrease the impact of fear from terrorism and increased technology would promote tourism and communication.  The Union generally agreed that military force was not needed but rather an evacuation would undergo.  The Union seems to believe that doing exactly what a terrorist group wants to enforce, fear, is the best solution to a terrorist attack.  What all of these ideas have in common, therefore, is the long-term impact that the Union seems to believe is most important.  However, a few decades later, in the current year 2090, the world is still ending in an extreme crisis.  Where did the African Union go wrong?  That can be answered with another question: what are the immediate short-term alleviation solutions for the Lake Chad terrorist attack?</p>

        <h3>What really went on  in the African Union Committee at EagleMUNC VII?
By Ted Stevens
</h3>
        <p>
	An unknown terrorist has terrorized Lake Chad in Africa. Delegates work to solve this urgent crisis at hand, with two distinct blocs forming. The first directive, sponsored by delegates such as South Africa, Somalia, and Eswatini, focuses on long term solutions. They focus to strengthening intelligence, tightening control of dark web, and giving clean drinking water to regions affected. This focus would also have added benefits such as improved infrastructure and an increase in tourism. The second directive focuses on giving short term solutions to the terrorist attack in Chad. This is sponsored by countries such as Benin, Burundi, and Chad itself. Their paper focuses on evacuating Lake Chad from the disaster zone,sending clean water to affected areas, and sending refugees to surrounding countries. This a conflict that is not only a clear safety threat to those living near Lake Chad and surrounding areas, but is also an environmental disaster. Although this represents the unsettling reality that terrorists can cause major environmental catastrophes, it is unlikely that is this places much effect on the cause of our problems today, seeing as this is one lake in Africa. Thus, it would not be smart to waste our one and only use of our time capsule on this and we should focus our efforts elsewhere and hope they come to a comprehensive solution.

        <h3>The Critical Nature of Environmental Protection by Buchanan Kennedy IV Ph. D</h3>
        <p>Our Earth is dying. Our Earth is sustaining the life of the human population. Hence, our people are going to die should we not take action in regards to the environment. It is absolutely essential for our committee to realize that Environmental Protection is the most pressing topic of our time. Natural disasters are decimating the world, and rain forests, which produce huge amounts of the consumable oxygen in our atmosphere, are receding at unprecedented rates. It is critical that we put this issue first, and have it take precedence over issues of human rights an issues of violence. Though these may be extremely important and pressing issues, they do not hold the fate of the world in their grips. I strongly advocate for an interventionist policy in regards to climate change and other environmental issues.

        <h3>The Distraction of Militarization from the Importance of Economic Improvement in the Qing Dynasty by Autumn McDermott
</h3>
        <p>Upon visiting the Qing Dynasty Committee, I was struck with the heavy focus on increasing militarization. Debate was dominated with talk of the navy, and sending spies to India to gather intelligence on British ships was mentioned. There was some back-and-forth regarding how beneficial increasing military size would be regarding economic state, and it was noted that sending farmers to the army would decrease agricultural production and negatively impact the economy. However, some delegates did argue the value of the respect that would be gained from Western powers in developing a powerful military.
	It’s important to note, from seeing this committee in action, the negative impact that focus on militarization, as opposed to economic development, has on a society. Do the Qing Dynasty’s attempts to increase military size and strength, mainly for the sake of appearances, benefit them in the long run? Would it be more effective for them to keep their farmers at home, and gain power and stability through increasing agricultural production and trade to boost their economy?
	Today, we need to look at the misguidedness of the Qing Dynasty, and apply the lessons learned from their mistakes to the world today. We need to further develop our world, using tools such as safe nuclear energy to provide a clean energy source to power our needs. Focus on war--tearing each other apart--and allotting people and resources to that cause, will draw us from advancements that need to be made, and slow our progress with environmental improvement.

    <h3>Mid 1800's, China by Maria Gonzalez</h3>
    <p>The Quing Dynasty is coming to a point of chaos as new rules and regulations have taken place. Under Chinese law, citizens are no longer able to trade opium, a traded that employed many in China. On top of this, their ports are under foreign rule. These travesties are causing the people, especially those of the working and lower class, to begin to rebel. Riots are forming against the prohibition of the opioid trade and a solution needs to be created to solve the unemployment of the citizens.

The committee did address this issue, realizing that the unemployment of the masses is not only a violation against human rights but also a violation of the reputability of their own country. Yet, the way they want to deal with this issue varies significantly, with solutions ranging from a more military focus to the creation of more technologically advanced ships. It is still unclear how to effectively solve this violation as the solutions brought up are still rudimentary at best.

        <h3>Grain Shortage Discovered</h3>
        <p>Berlin---Germany is on the verge of famine.  Following the usual grain binge due to the hype of Oktoberfest in Bavaria, the entire country is severely low on grain production.  Even Oktoberfest had dangerously low amounts of beer, pretzels, and wienerschnitzel.  The German government fears that due to the environmental conditions as a result of Climate Change may cause the Country to cut back to a no wheat diet.  The grain storehouses are empty and the farmers are struggling to produce even enough to feed their local areas.
	Germany, a leading exporter of grain, not only fears their country may starve, but also their economy may begin to fail.  Their net exports have been slowly declining but analysts are projecting that this shortage will culminate in a serious hit for their GDP.  They also fear this inflation may cause a continent-wide depression in addition to the hunger of the masses.
	When talking with a grain farmer in Bavaria he shared his fears.  “DAS IST NICHT GUT!” (THIS ISN’T GOOD!).  “Wir haben ein schlechtes Jahr und das ist ein nochmal Problem. Ein sehr großes Problem.” (We are having a bad year and this is just another problem, a very big problem.)  The Germans fear that the rise in prices for flour and bread will cause nationwide hunger, and for a country that often houses poor migrants this could spell disaster.
	The EU released a statement on the grain shortage saying, “Our hope is that the Germans will be able to produce enough grain to sustain themselves for the rest of the year, but after that we have no means to provide for them considering they were Europe’s main supplier.  We can only hope that the farmers pull through with a great harvest next year.”
	Is this the end of Oktoberfest? Will Germany starve? Will the economy fail, leading to a Europe-wide depression? No one is sure, but the situation is dire.

        <h3>The Ignored Crisis of the World Food Programme
 by Emmett Brown</h3>
        <p>When examining the current food shortage and humanitarian disasters of the present, it is necessary to look back on past international actions to prevent the development of such a severe situation. However, the historical record proves unimpressive, and this can be narrowed down to one recurring issue: funding. For example, in the World Food Programme sessions back in 2019, factions formed between smaller nations like Vietnam and larger nations like China. While developed nations appeared more than willing to donate funds to developing nations, this was sometimes viewed as “neo-colonialism” by the developing nations who prefered self-sufficiency.

But funding has always been an issue in widespread policy and always will be. However, in the narrow focus of producing sustainable food, the answer counterintuitively lies in state-of-the-art technology. Even as early as 2019, nations like Japan began noticing that industrial polymers are incredibly absorbent and can actually be used to create an arable environment where previously there was only non arable land or land devastated by pollution and climate change. Considering the cheapness and reusability of this polymer technology, the overall cost of transforming non arable land to arable land is actually quite small in comparison to alternatives. When utilized in conjunction with hydroponic vertical farming, film farming may be the way future for a society with limited farmland to feed and ever-growing population.

Had the World Food Programme at the time understood the cost effectiveness of seemingly expensive solutions, the current state may have been prevented. However, it is still not too late to implement such sustainable farming techniques now to secure a stable future.

        <h3>Terrorism in Africa Distracts from Enviromental Problems by Jean Paul Berger</h3>
        <p>The African Union has been known to use the tools available to them to try and stop terrorists from poisoning their people. Lake Chad was chemically poisoned by an unknown terrorist group. The African Union’s focus was on trying to prevent the damage that could result from such an attack. They lacked interest in trying to solve the environmental problems that plague us today.
	This is a simple case of humans fighting humans rather than the larger problems that surround us, such as our environment. Helping people to see that other humans are not lessers, but equals will help to stop such terrorist attacks and focus our attention on our crumbling environment. Human rights issues must be addressed if the world is to be saved from our past mistakes.
